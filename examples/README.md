# Examples
  Textifier needs CORS access, which means that it will have to be run in a local server, it won't work on a simple html page.

  This directory already comes with a simple node server that will serve the example pages.

  You can run it from the root folder like this.
  ```bash
  npm run examples
  # OR
  node examples/server.js
  ```
